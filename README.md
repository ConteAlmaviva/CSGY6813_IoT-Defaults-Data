This is a combined packet capture of data for the Fall 2020 semester of CSGY6813 - Information Security and Privacy at NYU, taken as part of the Cyber Fellows MSc curriculum. The focus of this project is on Internet of Things devices and sensible defaults that could be incorporated into consumer home routers to permit IoT devices to function, but limit their usefulness as attack platforms (both on the consumer's home network as well as Internet targets).

The PCAP attached is a composite of a continuous capture (files rotated every 30 minutes) for just under 7 days, captured on a router to which several IoT devices were attached. I have stripped all packets with a local destination (i.e. a destination in RFC1918 space), as the focus here is on outbound traffic more so than inbound. I've also filtered out incidental traffic generated by my phone as I did have to attach to the IoT network briefly in order to set up the IoT devices.
